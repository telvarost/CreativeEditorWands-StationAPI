# CreativeEditorWands StationAPI for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3

A StationAPI mod for Minecraft Beta 1.7.3 that adds world edit type properties to wooden tools when enabled.
* Mod (mostly) works on Multiplayer with [GlassConfigAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/glass-config-api) version 3.0+ used to sync configs!

## List of changes

All changes only apply when player is OP or in single-player toggle wands on/off via bedrock.

* Selection Tool (wooden axe)
  * Mode 1: Select two points (`right-click` on two blocks)
  * Mode 2: Copy selection (area between the two points) over to the new area `right-click`
  * Mode 3: Fill selection (area between the two points) with whatever block is `right-clicked`
  * Use `scroll-wheel` in inventory to rotate selection (does nothing if no selection has been made)
    * Hit living entities to rotate selection in multiplayer (also works in single-player)
  * Hold `left-shift` and use `scroll-wheel` to change axe mode in single-player
  * Use `right-click` in the air to change axe mode in multiplayer

## Structure Command

If you are using [RetroCommands](https://modrinth.com/mod/retrocommands) with this mod, you now also have access to the `/structure` command.
This command allows you to save, copy, and paste structures.
* NOTE: This command currently does not work with modded blockstates

How it works:
1. `/structure 1` to set the first position of the structure to copy (this happens where your player is standing)
2. `/structure 2` to set the second position of the structure to copy (this happens where your player is standing)
3. `/structure copy SaveName` copies the structure using a cube between positions 1 and 2
   - `SaveName` can be anything you want and is the saved name of the structure.
   - You can save as many structures as you want, just don't reuse the same name unless if you want to overwrite that structure.
4. `/structure paste SaveName` pastes the structure at the location the player is currently standing at
5. `/structure fill BlockID (BlockMeta)` fills the structure with the provided block ID (and optionally metadata value) using a cube between positions 1 and 2
